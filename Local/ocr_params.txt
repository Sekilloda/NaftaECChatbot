# Tesseract Page Segmentation Modes (PSM)
# 0    Orientation and script detection (OSD) only.
# 1    Automatic page segmentation with OSD.
# 2    Automatic page segmentation, but no OSD, or OCR.
# 3    Fully automatic page segmentation, but no OSD. (Default)
# 4    Assume a single column of text of variable sizes.
# 5    Assume a single uniform block of vertically aligned text.
# 6    Assume a single uniform block of text.
# 7    Treat the image as a single text line.
# 8    Treat the image as a single word.
# 9    Treat the image as a single word in a circle.
# 10   Treat the image as a single character.
# 11   Sparse text. Find as much text as possible in no particular order.
# 12   Sparse text with OSD.
# 13   Raw line. Treat the image as a single text line, bypassing hacks that are Tesseract-specific.
